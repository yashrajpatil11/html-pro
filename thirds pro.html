Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri,
near the city of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in service of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_Shahi_dynasty">Bijapuri Sultanate</a>
- a tripartite association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also
owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji’s mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao
Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was especially close to his mother who instilled in him a
strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his time outside of Pune, the
responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the shoulders of a small council of ministers
which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath
Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanhoji_Jedhe">Kanhoji Jedhe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Shivaji">Baji Pasalkar</a>
were appointed to train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai Nimbalkar 
in 1640.</p>

of the Maratha empire. Shivaji renamed the fort''Prachandagad''as Torna, and constructed several monuments and towers 
within it. in the 18th century,the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal empire</a> briefly gained control of this fort after the assassination of Shivaji's
